	AI_PEACE_DESIRE_FROM_LOYALISTS = -400 # Was -25. If folks are 100% behind the Gov/SotN, they'd fight to the bitter end, out of spite if nothing else
	AI_PEACE_DESIRE_FROM_DEVASTATION = 100 # Was 50. If all your factories are bombed I don't think you would wanna stick around.

	AI_PEACE_DESIRE_FROM_GOLD_RESERVES = -25 # Was -50. No amount of gold can turn a war around, the era of the Die Reisl√§ufer is over.
