 napoleonic_flavor.1.t:0 "The Second Republic"
 napoleonic_flavor.1.d:0 "Discontent with the political situation reached its peak as crowds poured into the streets of Paris and erected barricades. In what many saw as an accident, a French guardsman opened fire with his musket on the townspeople and carried out a massacre. Rioting like fire engulfed the entire city, with crowds chanting "Long live the reforms!" and "Down with the king!" Despite assurances that the situation was under control, the king fled the country... Now the government is faced with the task of creating a new system, beginning with the organization of the election of a new head of state."
 napoleonic_flavor.1.f:0 "«Citizens, for me, the red flag, I will never adopt it, and I am going to tell you why I'm against it with all the strength of my patriotism. It's that the tricolor has toured the world with the Republic and the Empire, with your freedoms and your glories, and the red flag has only toured the Champ-de-Mars, dragged in the blood of the people.» - Alphonse de Lamartine"

 napoleonic_flavor.2.d:0 "Overnight, the most influential figures of the opposition political parties were arrested, military troops occupied strategic squares and streets in Paris, and proclamations were posted on house corners announcing the dissolution of Parliament and the restoration of universal suffrage, inviting the people to allow the head of state to really govern the country. The next day barricades were erected in several places, but all attempts at rebellion were quickly crushed. Soon a popular vote of seven and a half million votes to 650,000 approved the head of state's proposals, and Louis Napoleon promulgated a new constitution, modeled on the «constitutions of the empire»."
 napoleonic_flavor.2.f:0 "«If, on the contrary, you still have confidence in me, give me the means of accomplishing the great mission which I hold from you. This mission consists in closing the era of revolutions, in satisfying the legitimate wants of the people, and in protecting them against subversive passions. It consists, especially, in creating institutions which can survive men, and which will be foundations upon which one can build something durable.» - Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"

 napoleonic_flavor.3.t:0 "Proclamation of the Second Empire"
 napoleonic_flavor.3.d:0 "For the first time the fate of France was decided not in the capital but in the provinces. The plebiscite for the restoration of the empire, organized after the establishment of the regime of personal power, brought Louis-Napoleon the expected success. Seventy-six percent of voters voted for the empire, and soon Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was proclaimed «emperor of the French» under the name Napoleon III."
 napoleonic_flavor.3.f:0 "«There is, nevertheless, one apprehension, and that I shall set at rest. A spirit of distrust leads certain persons to say that the empire means war. I say, the empire means peace. France longs for peace, and if France is satisfied the world is tranquil. War is not made with pleasure, it is made by necessity, and in these changing times where everywhere, next to so many elements of prosperity spring so many causes of death, we may say truthfully “Woe to whoever might give the signal for a collision in Europe, of which the consequences would be beyond our imaginations!”» - Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte"
 napoleonic_flavor.3.a:0 "Vive L'Empereur!"
 napoleonic_flavor.4.t:0 "Fall of the Second Empire"
 napoleonic_flavor.4.d:0 "The emperor had finally lost support among the common people, the intelligentsia, and the bourgeoisie. All hopes for a bright future and the ascension of France to greatness, which had arisen at the time of the proclamation of the Second Empire, have dissipated. The Emperor had by his actions nurtured many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they chose the moment to strike. They assembled at the Palais des Bourbons, where they announced the overthrow of the Emperor and the proclamation of the Third French Republic. The Bonapartist forces were unable to oppose them, and were forced with great reluctance to acknowledge what had happened."
 napoleonic_flavor.4.f:0 "«Frenchmen! The people have forestalled the Chamber that was hesitating. To save the country in danger, they claimed for the Republic: it is announced, and this revolution is led to the public law’s and public safety’s names. Citizens, watch over the city that is given to you; tomorrow, you will be with the army of the country’s avengers!» - Léon Gambetta"

 bourbon_restauration.1.d:0 "Despite the obstructions of the Orleanist regime, the supporters of Legitimism and the Bourbon dynasty were able to seize the reins of power from the rapidly losing popularity of the Orleanist party. The provisional government urged Henri d'Artois, grandson of Charles X, deposed in the 1830 revolution, to return from exile and accept the crown of France."
 bourbon_restauration.1.f:0 "«The monarchy in France is the royal house of France indissolubly united to the nation. I therefore maintain my right, which is the surest guarantee of yours, and, taking God as my witness, I declare to France and to the world that, faithful to the laws of the kingdom and to the traditions of my forefathers, I will religiously preserve until my last breath the deposit of the hereditary monarchy which Providence has entrusted to me for safekeeping, and which is the only port of salvation in which, after so many storms, this France, the object of all my love, will be able to find at last rest and happiness.» - Henri, Count of Chambord"
