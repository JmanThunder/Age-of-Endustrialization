He was bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it."-Chief Justice Taney"
 mexican_american.9.d:0 "A case has come before the Supreme Court. Dredd Scott, an enslaved black man, was taken from Missouri, a slave state, into wiscounsin, where slavery is illegal.

Sandford has claimed that he must remain a slave and property."

Brown's party of 35 men and women, armed with Sharps carbines provided by Northern Abolitionists, successfully cut off telegraph lines and communication, before seizing control of the armory. Tubman, using her contacts in the underground railroad, gathered nearby slaves who escaped from their plantations en-masse, bolstering the raiders with over three hundred men, now armed with army rifles. The rebels first overwhelmed the local miliamen with ease, but were later caught in firefights with the U.S. marines, leading to large casualties. The rebels would free the majority of West Virginia's slaves before escaping North, with [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_to_display_john_brown').GetFullName] and Tubman still at large. The largest slave revolt in American history has shook the nation."

After attempts to demand safe passage for the hostages failed, Brown ordered the execution of all twenty hostages before himself dying in the defense."
