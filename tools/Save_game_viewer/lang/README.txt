This directory contains all translations for the Pdx-Unlimiter.
You can contribute by doing the following:

- Check if your language is already listed in the file languages.json.
  If not, add the language id and the two-letter language code
  (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) to the list.

- Create copies of the english translation files and rename the language suffix

- Add your translated strings to the files

- Test them out by restarting the Pdx-Unlimiter and selecting your language in the settings menu.
  (Also uncheck "Use game language" to always use your chosen language.)

- Submit them either on GitHub or on Discord

Note:
This directory gets overwritten when a Pdx-Unlimiter update is downloaded.
Always make backups of your translation files!
